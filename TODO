There's a lot to do, really.

- Add proper build system
- Port to other platforms (Windows anyone?)
- Try different Cairo surfaces (ps, pdf, png, OpenGL, etc.)

- Implement TextMatrix in CGContext (may need to use internal Cairo APIs)
- Implement missing glyph drawing functions and finish ShowText
- Implement Image drawing
- Implement Patterns and Shading
- Implement Path handling functions
- Implement color management (could use lcms?)

- Fix device transform in Cairo and get rid of CTM patching hacks


Design principles to follow:
============================
- Build on public Cairo APIs as much as possible, use private APIs only if
  there is no appropriate public one or would simplifiy implementation a lot
- Avoid duplicate representatation of the same thing (should not store a copy
  of what Cairo already stores to avoid getting out of sync or too many
  conversions). Choose between Quartz or Cairo representation and convert to
  that and then stick to it.
- Keep performance in mind. This is a low level part of the system that
  should be fast, small and stable so follow K.I.S.S.
- Keep dependencies clean, only #include what you need and put functions
  that depend on the same thing in one file.
