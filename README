What is Opal?
-------------

Opal is a vector drawing library with an API similar to
Quartz 2D <http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?CoreGraphics>.
Opal is built on top of Cairo <http://www.cairographics.org>.

Opal is also a gemstone consisting of amorphous hydrated
silicon dioxide (SiO2 · nH2O) which is sometimes included
in the quartz group of minerals.

There is a homepage (which may not be updated too frequently) at

The sources are available from the GNUstep repository at
